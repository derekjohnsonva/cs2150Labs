The first problem I encountered while trying to get my code to work came 
from my number List being a private variable. My push, pop, and top 
methods were failing in my main method when I tried to call them. I realized 
after some debugging that the issue was that these methods were not in scope.
To fix this I had to make a push, pop, and top method in my postfixCalc files.
This fixed the scope issues.

The problem that set me back the farthest is kind of embarassing. I had 
declaired 
List * nums;
in my postfixCalc.h file and then in my constructor for postfixCalc I had 
the line
List * nums = new List();
After several hours of debugging and tracing through the values pointers were
referencing I started looking back at my implementation from the in lab and 
realized my problem. I had created a new List pointer instead of using the 
one from my postfixCalc.h file. To fix this I just changed the line in my 
constructor to
nums = new List();
